Components: Standardized Definition and Scope
---------------------------------------------

OSIA provides seamless interconnection between multiple components part of the identity ecosystem.

The components are defined as follows:

- The *Enrollment* component.

  Enrollment is defined as a system to register biographic and
  biometric data of individuals.

- The *Population Registry* (PR) component.

  Population registry is defined as "an individualized data system, that is, a mechanism of continuous recording,
  or of coordinated linkage, of selected information pertaining to each member of the resident population
  of a country in such a way to provide the possibility of determining up-to-date information concerning
  the size and characteristics of that population at selected time intervals. The population register is
  the product of a continuous process, in which notifications of certain events, which may have been
  recorded originally in different administrative systems, are automatically linked on a current basis.
  A. method and sources of updating should cover all changes so that the characteristics of individuals in the
  register remain current. Because of the nature of a population register, its organization, and also
  its operation, must have a legal basis." [#]_

- The *UIN Generator* component.

  UIN generator is defined as a system to generate and manage unique identifiers.

- The *Automated Biometric Identification System* (ABIS) component.

  An ABIS is defined as a *system to detect
  the identity of an individual when it is unknown, or to verify the individual's identity when it is
  provided, through biometrics*.

- The *Civil Registry* (CR) component.

  Civil registration is defined as "the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence
  and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population, as provided through decree or regulation
  is accordance with the legal requirement in each country.
  Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the documents provided by the law." [#]_

- The *Credential Management System* (CMS) component.

  CMS is defined as a system to manage the production and
  issuance of credentials such as ID Cards, passports, driving licenses, digital ID, etc.

- The *Third Party Services* component.

Interfaces
----------

This chapter describes the following interfaces:

- Notification

  A set of services to manage notifications for different types of events as for instance birth and death.

- Data access

  A set of services to access data.

  The design is based on the following assumptions:

  #. All persons recorded in a registry have a UIN. The UIN can be used as a key to access person data for all records.
     Please note that the UIN is the same throughout all registries (see Chapter 3 - Security & Privacy).
  #. The registries (civil, population, or other) are considered as centralized systems that are connected.
     If one registry is architectured in a decentralized way, one of its component must be centralized, connected to the network, 
     and in charge of the exchanges with the other registries.
  #. Since the registries are customized for each business needs, dictionaries must be explicitly defined to describe the attributes, 
     the event types, and the document types. See Data Access for samples of those dictionaries.
  #. The relationship parent/child is not mandatory in the population registry. A population registry implementation may manage this 
     relationship or may ignore it and rely on the civil registry to manage it.
  #. All persons are stored in the population registry. There is no record in the civil registry that is not also in the population registry.

- UIN Management

  A set of services to manage the unique identifier.

-  Enrollment Services

  A set of services to manage biographic and biometric data upon collection.

- Population Registry Services

  A set of services to manage a registry of the population.

- Biometrics

  A set of services to manage biometric data and databases.

- Credential Services

  A set of services to manage credentials, physical and digital.

- ID Usage

  A set of services implemented on top of identity systems to favour third parties consumption of identity data.

- Under discussion

  A set of services under discussion and not yet linked to any specific tag.

The following table describes in detail the interfaces and associated services.

Use Cases - How to Use |project|
--------------------------------

Below are a set of examples of how OSIA interfaces could be implemented in various use cases.

Birth Use Case
""""""""""""""

.. uml::

    :scale: 50%

    !include "skin.iwsd"

    participant "PR" as PR
    participant "UIN Generator" as UINGen

    activate parent
    activate CR
    
    group 1. Checks
        CR -> PR: matchPersonAttributes(mother attributes)
        CR -> PR: matchPersonAttributes(father attributes)
        CR -> PR: readPersonAttributes(mother)
        CR -> PR: readPersonAttributes(father)
        CR -> PR: queryPersonUIN(new born attributes)
        CR -> CR: Additional checks
    end
    
    group 2. Creation
        CR -> UINGen: generateUIN()
        CR -> CR
        note right: register the birth

        CR -->> parent: certificate
        destroy parent
    end
    
    group 3. Notification
        CR ->> PR: publish(birth,UIN)
        deactivate CR

        ...
        
        PR -> CR: readPersonAttributes(new born)
        activate PR
        PR -> CR: readPersonAttributes(mother)
        PR -> CR: readPersonAttributes(father)
        PR -> PR
        note right: create/update identities
        deactivate PR
    end
  
1. Checks

   When a request is submitted, the CR may run checks against the data available in the PR using:

   - ``matchPersonAttributes``: to check the exactitude of the parents' attributes as known in the PR
   - ``readPersonAttributes``: to get missing data about the parents's identity
   - ``qureyPersonUIN``: to check if the new born is already known to PR or not

   How the CR will process the request in case of data discrepancy is specific to each CR implementation
   and not in the scope of this document.

2. Creation

   The first step after the checks is to generate a new UIN. To do so, the CR requests a new UIN to the PR using generateUIN service.
   At this point the birth registration takes place.
   How the CR will process the birth registration is specific to each CR implementation and not in the scope of this document.
    
3. Notification

   As part of the birth registration, it is the responsibility of the CR to notify other systems, including the PR,
   of this event using:
   
   - ``publish``: to send a *birth* along with the new ``UIN``.
   
   The PR, upon reception of the birth event, will update the identity registry with this new identity using:
    
   - ``readPersonAttributes``: to get the attributes of interest to the PR for the parents if relevant and the new child.

Deduplication Use Case
""""""""""""""""""""""

During the lifetime of a registry, it is possible that duplicates are detected. This can happen for instance
after the addition of biometrics in the system. When a registry considers that two records are actually the same
and decides to merge them, a notification must be sent.

.. uml::

    !include "skin.iwsd"

    activate CR
    activate PR
    CR -> CR: merge()
    deactivate PR
    note right: merge/register duplicate
    deactivate CR
  
How the target of the notification should react is specific to each subsystem.
